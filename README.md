# Exercises

This repository contains exercise sets we use in workshops and meetups when learning new programming languages.

Each set of exercises contains different exercises but laid out the same way and roughly the same difficulty progression.

> This is still work in progress

## Progression

- **Task 1** - Introduces the simples concepts: input, output, compiling and running.
- **Task 2** - Works with loops, conditionals, objects, etc.
- **Task 3** - Works with file io, sorting and filtering lists, etc.
- **Project** - Introduces a bigger project to spend the rest of the time on. This usually includes talking with external web services, databases and touches on the full feature set of a programming language.
